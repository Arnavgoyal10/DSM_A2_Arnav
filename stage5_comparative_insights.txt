Stage 5 – Comparative Insights
===============================

Using current outputs:
- Impact: emdat_events_impact.csv
- Media: reliefweb_media_events.csv (500 reports for Indonesia, 476 for Myanmar)

Computed metrics:

Event A – Indonesia 2018 (Central Sulawesi Earthquake and Tsunami)
- event_label: Indonesia_2018_09_28_M7.5
- total_reports ≈ 500
- total_affected = 2,000,000
- total_damages_usd ≈ 1.45B
- economic_damage_per_capita ≈ 725 USD per affected person
- Forgotten Crisis Index (news volume per affected person) =
  total_reports / total_affected ≈ 500 / 2,000,000 ≈ 0.00025

Event B – Myanmar 2025 (Myanmar Earthquake)
- event_label: Myanmar_2025_03_M7.7
- total_reports ≈ 476
- total_affected ≈ 1,355,104
- total_damages_usd ≈ 11.0B
- economic_damage_per_capita ≈ 8,117 USD per affected person
- Forgotten Crisis Index (news volume per affected person) =
  total_reports / total_affected ≈ 476 / 1,355,104 ≈ 0.0003513

Forgotten Crisis Index interpretation:
- The index measures how much media coverage each affected person “receives”:
  FCI = total_reports / total_affected.
- Indonesia 2018: FCI ≈ 0.00025
- Myanmar 2025: FCI ≈ 0.00035
- Myanmar’s crisis has more news per affected person, so Indonesia 2018 is relatively
  more “forgotten”: more people affected per unit of coverage.

Vulnerability / coping capacity proxy:
- We use economic_damage_per_capita (total_damages_usd / total_affected) as a proxy
  for both vulnerability and coping capacity (higher damage per affected person suggests
  higher-value assets exposed and/or weaker capacity to prevent losses):
  - Indonesia 2018: ~725 USD per affected person
  - Myanmar 2025: ~8,117 USD per affected person
- Myanmar’s event appears economically more intense per affected person, indicating
  greater economic vulnerability or lower coping capacity, even though media coverage
  per affected person is also higher than for Indonesia.

Sentiment & tone: historical vs current (analytical vs alarmist)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We compare the measured headline sentiment (VADER compound) and its volatility
between Event A and Event B using the exact values from `stage4_event_summary.json`.

- Indonesia 2018 (historical, 445 headlines):
  - mean compound sentiment = **-0.0866**
  - standard deviation (volatility) = **0.3444**
  - interpretation: tone is on average mildly negative, with a fairly wide spread
    across headlines (mix of sharply negative and more neutral pieces).

- Myanmar 2025 (recent, 216 headlines):
  - mean compound sentiment = **-0.0638**
  - standard deviation (volatility) = **0.3190**
  - interpretation: still negative on average, but less negative and slightly
    less volatile than Indonesia 2018.

Interpretation of the change:
- Both disasters are framed in overall negative terms, but headlines around
  **Myanmar 2025** are closer to neutral and show a tighter spread than those
  for **Indonesia 2018**.
- This points to a modest shift away from highly alarmist, emotionally charged
  language toward a more measured/analytical style for the recent event:
  fewer extreme sentiment swings and slightly more neutral framing, even though
  the underlying economic impact is much larger.

Alternative comparative insight (using existing data only, no GDACS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not have GDACS alert level or formal coping capacity, so we derive an
alternative insight from magnitude, impact, and media:

Insight – Magnitude, economic intensity, and media focus:
- Event B (Myanmar 2025) has higher magnitude (7.7 vs 7.5) and much higher
  total damage (approx 11B vs approx 1.45B USD) and economic damage per capita
  (approx 8,117 vs approx 725 USD per affected person). Death tolls are similar
  (approx 3.8k vs approx 4.1k).
- Despite that, total media volume (report count) is almost the same for both
  events (approx 476 vs approx 500). Numerically, Indonesia 2018 gets
  ~3.4×10⁻⁷ reports per USD of damage (≈500 / 1.45B), while Myanmar 2025 gets
  ~4.3×10⁻⁸ reports per USD (≈476 / 11.0B) — around **8× less coverage per
  dollar of damage** for the more recent, more intense event.
- Interpretation: within this two‑event sample, the historical Indonesia disaster
  appears to have been over‑represented in media relative to its economic scale,
  while the current Myanmar event looks under‑covered given how concentrated and
  costly the impact is. This shows that equal raw news volume does *not* imply
  equal attention to human or economic impact; pairing media metrics with impact
  indicators (FCI, economic_damage_per_capita) is essential to surface these
  imbalances.
